The **Feral File** app enhances the digital experience, increasing the ways people can share, organize, explore, and live with software-based artwork.


#### Explore Feral File Exhibitions

- Each exhibition on **Feral File** begins with the curator. World-class artists collaborate with visionary curators to create and exhibit artworks around a single, ambitious theme.

- Exhibitions never close on **[feralfile.com](https://feralfile.com/)**. Soon, all exhibitions will be viewable and streamable on the **Feral File** app. For now, the current exhibition is on view.


#### Live with digital art

- Stream digital artwork to any compatible screen. Share and enjoy your favorite pieces with family, friends, and colleagues at home and in the office.

- For interactive works, your mobile device becomes the remote control. Use the keyboard, experiment with the artist’s commands, and dive into the immersive world of software-based art.


#### Organize

- Consolidate collected digital art across blockchains (Ethereum and Tezos)

- Create collections within your collection.

- The app classifies artwork into 3 categories: Still, Video, Interactive.


#### Share

- Co-create a digital chain letter with [MoMA Postcard](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/5618). This experiment in borderless collaboration and creativity explores ways individuals, groups, and institutions can make and own digital goods.

- The “View existing address” feature allows you to see other collections and share yours with friends.

Bitmark started with the idea of building tools to help individuals and institutions secure digital property rights. Feral File, an online gallery co-founded by Casey Reas, applies this vision to art made with software, helping artists and collectors secure the property rights to their artwork. Visit feralfile.com and experience world-class digital art in-situ. The **Feral File** app goes beyond ownership and provides dynamic ways to engage with digital art on your personal devices, in your home, and across the world.
