                "Casey Reas has been making abstract artworks with code for over twenty years. Crucially, he prefers that viewers experience his dynamic images as live “performances,” instead of screen recordings—that is, the work always should be generated in real time by a computer executing his instructions. (This is somewhat analogous to the difference between listening to a symphony live in a concert hall and as a recording.) In this way, he invites us to appreciate not only the outputs of his code—which are visually related to modernist art—but also the material and conceptual foundation of his work in the language of computation, which is his chosen “instrument.” <br/>In recent years, Reas has used the popular software language Processing, which he coauthored in 2001, to produce a series of works that pay explicit homage to the icons of twentieth-century abstraction. As he notes, the forms of these works refer to movements ranging from “concrete and non-objective art to color-field painting and minimalism.” In <em>METASOTO</em>, Reas offers a “meta” reflection on the work of Jesús Rafael Soto, a Venezuelan Op and kinetic artist of the 1960s who explored the aesthetic possibilities of industrial and synthetic materials such as nylon, steel, and Plexiglas. Soto’s sculptural construction <a href=\"https://buffaloakg.org/artworks/k19652-bois-tiges-de-fer\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\"><em>Bois-tiges de fer</em>, 1964</a>, is a Masonite board measuring over five feet wide and painted with vertical black lines, in front of which are hung thin steel wires bent into varying arcs. As the viewer passes in front of the work, the visual interference between the actual and painted lines creates a dizzying optical confusion. In the 1960s, this kind of “activation” of the viewer’s body using nontraditional materials was understood by some as a political act, insofar as it rejected the bourgeois model of art as expensive objects to be passively consumed. <br/>In <em>METASOTO</em>, Reas uses live code that we experience via our browsers to reimagine Soto’s sculpture as a dynamic composition of black and white intersecting lines. The black lines remain static, while the white lines move over them in ways that can make the black lines appear to be animated. Clicking on the image reveals a new pattern (although reloading the work will begin the same cycle over again), and each edition of the work presents an entirely different set of configurations. While Reas’s work reiterates Soto’s embrace of technology to activate the viewer, it also invites us to consider what it means for the viewer to activate technology—or even create their own digital systems.",

                "John Gerrard has built a practice developing simulation as a language and material, using this mode to examine issues related to energy, consumption, and environmental exploitation. “Smoke Hands (Dark) 2022” is a spatial WebGL sketch showing the artist’s hands cupped around dark smoke. The work was produced in early 2022 to test ideas around subjects of ecology, responsibility, futurism, and politics. Click and drag in background to look around the scene. The smoke, which is produced by a particle system, recalls the artist’s previous works, “Western Flag (Dalhart, Texas) 2017” and the earlier Smoke Tree series of 2006-7. “Smoke Hands” juxtaposes a symbol of destruction with a gesture of offering, instantly evoking the tension, absurdity, and peril of our dependence on carbon-based energy. As the artist says, “I like the sense that we are holding an uncertain future in our hands — or that we are protecting a global petro system that is in essence impossible.”<br/>Producer: Werner Poetzelberger <br/>Programmer: Helmut Bressler",

Emerging from Machine Hallucinations, Refik Anadol Studio’s multi-year research project that investigates data aesthetics based on collective visual memories of humanity, “Unsupervised — Machine Hallucinations — MoMA” processes 138,151 images from MoMA’s collection in the mind of a machine.\n\nFor this work and the other works in this collection, Anadol processed the entire digitized archive of MoMA through StyleGAN2, an algorithm developed by NVIDIA researchers with adaptive discriminator augmentation (ADA). He then explored a latent space with a custom software called a Latent Space Browser, which Refik Anadol Studio has been developing since 2017. \n\n“Unsupervised — Machine Hallucinations — MoMA” is a realtime, software artwork that moves through the latent space of the trained GAN to continuously generate new images. Because it’s too computationally intensive to run through a web browser on non-specialized computers, it is previewed as a captured video on the Feral File site. The artwork comes with an artist-signed 3D physical certificate with backup, a custom computer with software, and a Samsung 75\" QLED 4 display, to be shipped from the artist’s studio to the first collector in early 2022. This 1/1 unique video artwork will be collected through a highest-bid auction.",

            "description":
                "Starting with traditional art materials when he was young, Tyler Hobbs later found his way into creating images with code. Eventually, he stopped creating landscapes and portraits by hand and his work with code took center stage, but he never stopped working with traditional art materials. His graphite plotter drawings and hand-painted murals created from his code are essential elements of his work. For –GRAPH, Tyler has created “F(l)ight,” a study of the aesthetic overlap and differences between the natural world, hand-made artwork, and algorithmic tendencies. It’s a return to his long-standing interests in the continuum of representational images to total abstraction. In relation to his idea that code and algorithms become increasingly important within culture and art, Tyler says, “I am interested in what parts of the analog world we can capture, what we can improve, and what is lost.” \n\n“F(l)ight” is a software NFT, but the first collector of each edition will receive the corresponding plotter drawing shipped directly from the artist’s studio.

                "Starting with traditional art materials when he was young, Tyler Hobbs later found his way into creating images with code. Eventually, he stopped creating landscapes and portraits by hand and his work with code took center stage, but he never stopped working with traditional art materials. His graphite plotter drawings and hand-painted murals created from his code are essential elements of his work. For –GRAPH, Tyler has created “F(l)ight,” a study of the aesthetic overlap and differences between the natural world, hand-made artwork, and algorithmic tendencies. It’s a return to his long-standing interests in the continuum of representational images to total abstraction. In relation to his idea that code and algorithms become increasingly important within culture and art, Tyler says, “I am interested in what parts of the analog world we can capture, what we can improve, and what is lost.” <br/>“F(l)ight” is a software NFT, but the first collector of each edition will receive the corresponding plotter drawing shipped directly from the artist’s studio.

The artist and his team used MoMA archives to construct the seven dimensions of the artwork: x, y, z, r, g, b, and time.

Such is the unique brilliance of Jared S Tarbell that his work does not capture nature, it rivals it. \n\nThis work is a programmed system and the video artifact was a capture of live interaction by the artist.
